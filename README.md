Speaking of speed, accuracy, and usefulness, YOLOv8 is a big deal in computer vision, opening new possibilities for research and development. 
Developing autonomous vehicles and surveillance is very significant, and there is a lot of potential for further innovation and
exploration in this field, along with the advancement of electric vehicle technology.
YOLO (You Only Look Once)In the world of computer vision, YOLOv8 object detection really stands out for its super accuracy and speed.
Prerequisites:
We need to install packages and set up the environment to implement object detection using yolov8:
pip install ultralytics 
For Conda users:  conda install -c conda-forge ultralytics
Using docker: sudo docker pull ultralytics/ultralytics
And to set up the environment:
Install Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Create a Virtual Environment: Use python -m venv yolov8-env in your terminal to create a virtual environment.
Activate the environment.
